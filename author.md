## 1. Brief description of me

Self-taught software engineer that enjoy learning new things. I have a taste for learning foundations and reusable knowledge instead of keeping up with the latest trends.

## 2. Sources of inspiration

Some books and people have been a real inspiration to me and I list them in hope that someone else will look into them and get inspired the way I did.

### 2.1 Inspirational books

* [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition]() by Steve McConnell. <br /><br />I read this book about one year into my careeer and it had a great influence on how I write my code.

* [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles]() by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken <br /><br />This book manage to explain how every detail of a computer work in less than 300 pages, from boolean algebra to implementing a compiler for your own programming language. It is fantastic for people who don't have a computer science degree (and hopefully then know all those details).

### 2.2 Inspirational people

* Rob Pike - Designer of golang, clever and entertaining guy with a taste for simplicity.
