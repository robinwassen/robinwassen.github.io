## 1. Brief description of me

Self-taught software engineer that enjoy learning new things. I prefer to learn foundations and reusable knowledge instead of just keeping up with the latest trends.

Currently I build software for education at [DigiExam](https://www.digiexam.se), previously worked as an IT-consultant in the finance, telco and online gaming industries. In my freetime I enjoy poking around in open source projects and go rock climbing, so I write about that too.

Everything that I write on this blog are my personal thoughts and opinions and should not be associated with my work.

## 2 Projects I have been involved in

### 2.1 DigiExam (2012 - 2018)

I started my work on DigiExam as a consulant in 2012 and then took the role as CTO in 2013. The role as CTO has changed a lot as the company has grown. In the beginning it was basically to be a solo developer building the backend, frontend and native apps, it gradually moved towards building a team, acting as the face outwards for the product development and supporting other people working with the product and technology.

It is a fun project to work on, DigiExam is a heavy Google Cloud Platform user which is a nice platform to work with. Go turned out to be a great choice for writing the backend and building native apps using Electron is a joy.

There is also a whole domain that is extremly challenging and very specific to us, it is to technically solve the problem with prevent students from cheating at exams.

### 2.2 Sparta Sales (2013 - 2018)

Sparta Sales was started by a friend of mine that has a background in sales and marketing, I mentored him when he was building and shipping the MVP and got the role as advisor to the company. In 2017 I also invested in Sparta Sales. Sparta was acquired by Lime Technologies in April 2018.

Technology used to build the MVP was PHP and MySQL.

### 2.3 Attach.io (2014 - 2017)

Attach started as a weekend project that me and a product designer friend did, we built the MVP over a short period of time in Ruby on Rails. My motivation for doing the project was experiment with Ruby on Rails and having the joy of doing a new small project.

The project was then given to a friend that used it to start a company and recruit a technical co-founder. I was not involved in operations of the company to avoid conflict of interest, instead took the role as advisor. Supported with second opinion during recruitment of technical candidates and guidance with how to build an integration with Microsoft Outlook.

Technology used to build the MVP was Ruby on Rails, MySQL, docsplit and Heroku.
