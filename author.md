## Experience

### DigiExam (2012 - Current)

**CTO, Stockholm, Sweden**

I started my work on DigiExam as a consultant in 2012, took the role as CTO in 2013. The role as CTO has changed a lot as the company has grown. In the early days the role was basically to be a solo developer, gradually the role grew into building a product team, act as the face outwards for the product development and support the organization working with technology.

- Client applications built using AngularJS running in Electron on macOS and Windows, as a Chrome app on Chrome OS and in a custom WKWebView wrapper on iOS. Using numerous custom-built Node-modules written in C/C++/Objective-C++.

- Backend written in Go running on Google Cloud Platform. Using services such as App Engine, Datastore, BigQuery, Pub/Sub and Elastic search.

- Using Continuous Integration with Travis CI and AppVeyor to build, test and deploy the backend and client applications.
