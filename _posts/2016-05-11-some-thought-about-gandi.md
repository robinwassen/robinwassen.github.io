At work we currently have our domains at [dnsimple](https://dnsimple.com) and one.com. Of which dnsimple provides a great service, with a good interface and fair business, but unfortunately does not currently or plan to provide support for acting as a registrar for .se domains which removes it as an option for us. 

This made me research into options that has more breadth than dnsimple and ended up choosing [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/), after registering a large bulk of domains I must say that I am happy with that choice. I had about 3 different questions which required me to contact their support and  each of those questions were resolved within minutes. The only negative thing I can say about them is that their web interface is a bit slow.

But I fully understand why it is hard to find negative reviews about Gandi.
