## The Hills Have Allies - An Irish Bouldering Film (28min, 2016, David Fitzgerald)

![Image of The Hills Have Allies](/img/climbing-movies-the-hills-have-allies.jpg)

[Watch on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/175203095)

Quote from the movie author:

This video aims to highlight the passion in the Irish bouldering scene. Over time, I began to obsess over personal progress. It was with this that I discovered the beauty in projecting lines at my limit. The Wicklow mountains have always held such intrigue in my mind. 

I soon began to explore the rural landscape, throwing myself at the established test pieces. When I began climbing over three years ago, I dreamed of the effort required to succeed on such lines. Over the course of my discovery, with the help of others and a portion of self-taught practice, I began to adapt to the climbing style and embraced the projecting mentality. 

Spanning two years worth of effort, culminating last Spring, this is the product of that dream.
